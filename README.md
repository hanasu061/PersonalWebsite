# Brief
My website has three parts: home, hobby and about.
Home page has a music player, a beautiful poem and my ins link.
Hobby page has a table and many pictures.
About page is something about me and my email address.

# Landing page
Landing page has three navigational elements. They are Home, Hobby and About. 
They are internal links, too.

In the landing page, I create a music play button as interactive component.
When you click on it, it will play a music.

If you would like to pause, click it again.
