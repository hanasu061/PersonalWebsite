Landing page:
https://github.khoury.northeastern.edu/sihan/PersonalWebsite/blob/main/landing.png

My website has three parts: home, hobby and about.
Home page has a music player, a beautiful poem and my ins link.
Hobby page has a table and many pictures.
About page is something about me and my email address.

Landing page has three navigational elements. They are Home, Hobby and About. 
They are internal links, too.

In the landing page, I create a music play button as interactive component.
When you click on it, it will play a music.

If you would like to pause, click it again.

If you click on it, it will open a new browser which is my instagram page.
